# Explanation

This document provides background and conceptual overviews of the project.

## System Architecture
The application is built using the Fortress system architecture, which consists of five modular layers:
- **Business:** Defines the mission, roadmap, and requirements of the project.
- **Security:** Implements security best practices to protect the application and its users.
- **Knowledge:** Contains the domain knowledge and design tokens for the project.
- **Technical:** Includes the code and configuration for the application.
- **Documentation:** Provides documentation for the project.

This modular architecture makes it easy to understand, maintain, and extend the application.

## AI Workflows
AI workflows are orchestrated using a combination of LangChain and LangFlow.
- **LangChain** is used to create and manage chains of AI operations. This allows us to build complex workflows that involve multiple AI models and data sources.
- **LangFlow** is a graphical user interface for LangChain that allows us to visually design and prototype AI workflows. This makes it easy to experiment with different ideas and iterate quickly.

## Security Model
The security of the application is based on a defense-in-depth strategy.
- **Authentication:** All users are authenticated using Clerk.
- **Authorization:** Access to resources is restricted based on the user's role.
- **Data Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **Threat Modeling:** A threat model has been created to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
- **Regular Audits:** The application is regularly audited for security vulnerabilities.
