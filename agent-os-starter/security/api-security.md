# API Security Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for securing the application's API.

## Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on all API endpoints to protect against DoS attacks and brute-force attacks.
- The rate limit should be configurable and based on the user's IP address and/or API key.

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- Configure CORS to only allow requests from trusted domains.
- Avoid using wildcard `*` for the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in production.

## CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Protect against CSRF attacks by using anti-CSRF tokens.
- The token should be unique per user session and validated on the server side for all state-changing requests.

## Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Use a WAF to protect against common web application attacks such as XSS and SQL injection.
- The WAF should be configured to block malicious requests and log all security events.

## XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Prevent XSS by validating and sanitizing all user input.
- Use a content security policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of content that can be loaded by the browser.

## Injections
- Prevent injection attacks such as SQL injection by using parameterized queries or prepared statements.
- Avoid building queries dynamically with user-provided data.

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages.
- Return generic error messages to the client and log detailed error information on the server side.

## Input Validation
- Validate all input on the server side to ensure that it is of the correct type, format, and length.
- Reject any input that does not meet the validation criteria.

## API Versioning
- Use API versioning to allow for backward-compatible changes to the API.
- The version can be included in the URL or in a custom request header.

## Usage of API Gateway
- Use an API gateway to centralize API management tasks such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging.
- The API gateway can also be used to transform requests and responses.

## HTTPS
- Use HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server to encrypt data in transit.
- Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.
