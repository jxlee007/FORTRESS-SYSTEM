# Threat Model

This document outlines the threat model for the application, based on the STRIDE methodology.

## Assets
- **User Data:** Personally Identifiable Information (PII), authentication credentials, and user-generated content.
- **Application Code:** The source code for the application.
- **Infrastructure:** The servers, databases, and other infrastructure components that the application runs on.

## Trust Boundaries
- **Client-Side:** The user's web browser or mobile device.
- **Server-Side:** The application servers and database.
- **Third-Party Services:** External services such as Clerk for authentication and Stripe for payments.

## STRIDE Analysis

### Spoofing
- **Threat:** An attacker could impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Strong authentication controls via Clerk.
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    - Secure session management.

### Tampering
- **Threat:** An attacker could modify data in transit or at rest.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Use of TLS for all communication.
    - Data integrity checks.
    - Encryption of all sensitive data at rest.

### Repudiation
- **Threat:** A user could deny having performed an action.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Detailed logging of all user actions.
    - Audit trails for all security-related events.

### Information Disclosure
- **Threat:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Encryption of all sensitive data at rest and in transit.
    - Principle of least privilege to restrict access to data.
    - Secure error handling to prevent information leakage.

### Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Threat:** An attacker could make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Rate limiting on all API endpoints.
    - Use of a Web Application Firewall (WAF).
    - Scalable infrastructure to handle traffic spikes.

### Elevation of Privilege
- **Threat:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to privileged functionality.
- **Mitigation:**
    - Strict enforcement of user roles and permissions.
    - Secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could be exploited for privilege escalation.
    - Regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
