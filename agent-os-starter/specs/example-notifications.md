# Feature Spec: Notification System

## 1. Description
Notify users about important events in the application.

## 2. Problem
Users need to be informed about events such as task completions and billing updates.

## 3. Goal
- Keep users informed about important events.
- Provide a good user experience by sending timely and relevant notifications.
- Success will be measured by the open rate and click-through rate of notifications.

## 4. Non-Goals
- Real-time notifications (e.g., via WebSockets) will not be supported in the initial release.
- Users will not be able to customize their notification preferences in the initial release.

## 5. User Stories
- As a user, I want to receive an email notification when a long-running task is completed.
- As a user, I want to receive an email notification when my invoice is paid.
- As a user, I want to receive an email notification if my invoice payment fails.
- As a user, I want to see in-app notifications for less critical events.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] An email notification is sent when a task is completed.
- [ ] An email notification is sent when an invoice is paid.
- [ ] An email notification is sent when an invoice payment fails.
- [ ] In-app notifications are displayed for events such as new comments.
- [ ] Notifications are sent to the correct user.
- [ ] Notifications are sent in a timely manner.
- [ ] If a notification fails to send, the system retries up to 3 times.

## 7. Technical Design
- **Frontend:**
    - Use a library like `react-hot-toast` to display in-app notifications.
    - Create a notification center where users can view all their notifications.
- **Backend:**
    - Create a new Convex action for sending notifications.
    - Integrate with an email service provider like SendGrid.
    - Use a message queue to handle sending notifications asynchronously.
- **Database:**
    - Create a new `notifications` table to store all notifications.
    - The table will have columns for `userId`, `type`, `message`, `status`, and `createdAt`.

## 8. Open Questions
- What other events should trigger notifications?
- Should we support other notification channels such as SMS or push notifications?
