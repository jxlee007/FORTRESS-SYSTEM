# AI Observability with LangSmith/Langfuse

This document describes the observability strategy for AI workflows, including tracing, metrics, and error taxonomy using LangSmith and Langfuse.

## Tracing
- **LangSmith:** Used to trace the execution of LangChain chains and agents.
- **Langfuse:** Used to trace more complex AI workflows and provide detailed analytics.
- **Trace IDs:** A unique trace ID will be generated for each request and propagated through all services.

## Metrics
The following metrics will be collected to monitor the performance of the AI models:
- **Latency:** The time it takes for the model to generate a response.
- **Cost:** The cost of each API call to the AI model provider.
- **Token Usage:** The number of tokens used for each request.
- **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that result in an error.

## Error Taxonomy
Errors will be categorized into the following types:
- **Validation Errors:** The input to the AI model is invalid.
- **API Errors:** The API call to the AI model provider fails.
- **Model Errors:** The AI model returns an error or an unexpected response.
- **Guardrail Errors:** The input or output violates a guardrail.

## Dashboards
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** A real-time dashboard will be created to monitor the key metrics.
- **Historical Analysis:** A historical dashboard will be created to analyze trends over time.
- **Error Analysis:** A dashboard will be created to analyze the frequency and root cause of errors.

## Alerts
- **High Latency:** An alert will be triggered if the model latency exceeds a certain threshold.
- **High Error Rate:** An alert will be triggered if the error rate exceeds a certain threshold.
- **Budget Alerts:** An alert will be triggered if the cost of the AI model exceeds the budget.
