# AI Workflows with LangChain/LangFlow

This document describes the orchestration of AI workflows using LangChain and LangFlow, including agent roles, memory, and guardrails.

## Orchestration
- **LangChain:** Used to create and manage chains of AI operations.
- **LangFlow:** Used to visually design and prototype AI workflows.

## Agent Roles
- **Researcher:** An agent that can search the web for information.
- **Writer:** An agent that can generate text content.
- **Coder:** An agent that can write and debug code.
- **Orchestrator:** An agent that can coordinate the work of other agents.

## Memory
- **Short-Term Memory:** The agent's memory of the current conversation.
- **Long-Term Memory:** The agent's memory of past conversations, stored in a vector database.
- **Entity Memory:** The agent's memory of key entities and their relationships.

## Guardrails
- **Input Guardrails:** To prevent malicious input from being passed to the AI model.
- **Output Guardrails:** To prevent the AI model from generating harmful or inappropriate content.
- **Topical Guardrails:** To ensure that the AI model stays on topic.

## Example Workflow: Content Creation
1.  **User Request:** The user requests an article about a specific topic.
2.  **Orchestrator:** The orchestrator agent receives the request and breaks it down into smaller tasks.
3.  **Researcher:** The researcher agent searches the web for information about the topic.
4.  **Writer:** The writer agent uses the information gathered by the researcher to write the article.
5.  **Review:** The user reviews the article and provides feedback.
6.  **Iteration:** The writer agent revises the article based on the user's feedback.
7.  **Completion:** The article is finalized and delivered to the user.
