# Authentication Integration with Clerk

This document describes the integration of Clerk for user authentication, session management, and billing flows.

## Session Management
- Clerk's frontend SDK will be used to manage user sessions in the browser.
- Secure, HTTP-only cookies will be used to store session tokens.
- The session will be automatically refreshed in the background.

## Billing Flows
- Clerk's billing components will be used to handle subscription management and payments.
- Webhooks will be used to receive notifications from Stripe about payment events.
- The application will update the user's subscription status based on these events.

## Token Refresh
- The Clerk SDK will automatically handle token refresh.
- The frontend will be configured to use the `Authorization` header with the JWT for all API requests.
- The backend will validate the JWT on every request to a protected endpoint.

## Error States
- **401 Unauthorized:** This error will be returned if the user is not authenticated. The frontend should redirect the user to the login page.
- **403 Forbidden:** This error will be returned if the user is not authorized to access a resource. The frontend should display an appropriate error message.
- **Token Expired:** The Clerk SDK will handle token expiration by automatically refreshing the token. If the refresh fails, the user will be logged out.

## User Profile
- The application will sync user profile data from Clerk.
- Webhooks will be used to receive notifications from Clerk about changes to user data.
- The application will update its local copy of the user data based on these events.
