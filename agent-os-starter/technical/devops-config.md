# DevOps Configuration

This document describes the DevOps configuration for the project, including CI caching, pruned builds, environment variable scopes, and Turborepo/Nx config.

## CI/CD Pipeline
- **Provider:** [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- **Workflow:** The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- **Stages:**
    1.  **Lint:** Check the code for style issues.
    2.  **Test:** Run all unit, integration, and E2E tests.
    3.  **Build:** Build the application for production.
    4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the application to the staging and production environments.

## CI Caching
- **Purpose:** To speed up the CI/CD pipeline by caching dependencies.
- **Implementation:** The `actions/cache` action will be used to cache `node_modules` and other dependencies.
- **Key:** The cache key will be based on the lock file (e.g., `package-lock.json`).

## Pruned Builds
- **Purpose:** To reduce the size of the production build by removing unnecessary files.
- **Implementation:** A multi-stage Docker build will be used to create a minimal production image.
- **Tools:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Environment Variable Scopes
- **Development:** Environment variables will be stored in a `.env` file and loaded locally.
- **Staging:** Environment variables will be stored as secrets in GitHub and passed to the staging environment during deployment.
- **Production:** Environment variables will be stored as secrets in the production environment's configuration service.

## Monorepo Management (Turborepo/Nx)
- **Tool:** [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) will be used to manage the monorepo.
- **Configuration:** The `turbo.json` file defines the pipeline for building and testing the different applications and packages in the monorepo.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Faster Builds:** Turborepo will cache build outputs to avoid re-building code that hasn't changed.
    - **Simplified Scripts:** Turborepo simplifies the scripts for building, testing, and linting the monorepo.
    - **Code Sharing:** Turborepo makes it easy to share code between different applications and packages.
